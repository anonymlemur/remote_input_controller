# üìã Remote Input Controller - TODO List
*Updated: July 24, 2025* 

## üö® **CRITICAL ISSUE - HIGH PRIORITY**

### Server Start/Stop Functionality
- [ ] **FIX: Server Stop command not working**
  - ‚úÖ Tray menu sends `ServerCommand::Stop` successfully
  - ‚úÖ Command channel wiring is correct
  - ‚ùå **Server async loop not receiving Stop commands**
  - **Root Cause**: `accept_or_shutdown` method may be blocking and not yielding control
  - **Next Steps**: Add granular logging, simplify accept logic, test shutdown signal propagation

---

## ‚úÖ **COMPLETED - MAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENTS**

### Server Architecture & Reliability
- [x] **Refactored shutdown signaling** from `oneshot` to `tokio::sync::watch`
- [x] **Restructured Server::run** to poll both command_rx and accept/shutdown logic
- [x] **Added comprehensive logging** throughout server lifecycle
- [x] **Fixed all compilation errors** and type annotations
- [x] **Cleaned up codebase** - removed unused imports and commented code
- [x] **Server starts correctly** and binds to 127.0.0.1:8080
- [x] **HTTP/HTTPS dual-mode** with automatic certificate detection

### Tray Menu & UI
- [x] **Dynamic tray menu** - shows Start/Stop based on server status
- [x] **Tray menu event handling** working correctly
- [x] **Removed OpenGL dependencies** - replaced with native dialogs
- [x] **QR code generation** with fallback to system image viewer
- [x] **Cross-platform compatibility** for Windows systems

### Code Quality
- [x] **Modular architecture** with clean separation of concerns
- [x] **Error handling** with user-friendly messages
- [x] **Logging system** with timestamps and levels
- [x] **Build system** working without warnings (except unused variables)

## üîß **IN PROGRESS - DEBUGGING**

### Server Management
- [ ] **Debug Stop command flow**
  - Add more granular logging in `Server::run`
  - Verify `accept_or_shutdown` is not blocking indefinitely
  - Test shutdown signal propagation through watch channel
  - Consider separating accept loop from command processing

---

## üìã **PLANNED - MEDIUM PRIORITY**

### Server Features
- [ ] Add configurable server address/port
- [ ] Implement client authentication
- [ ] Add connection logging and client management
- [ ] Generate self-signed certificates if missing
- [ ] Add SSL certificate status UI

### User Experience
- [ ] Add server status display with auto-refresh
- [ ] Implement proper native Windows dialogs
- [ ] Add connected clients list with management
- [ ] Add configuration panel for settings
- [ ] Create installer package

### Windows Integration
- [ ] Add Windows firewall exception handling
- [ ] Test Windows UAC elevation requirements
- [ ] Add Windows startup registration option
- [ ] Verify Windows input simulation accuracy

## üß™ **TESTING CHECKLIST**

### Core Functionality
- [x] Server starts and binds to port 8080
- [x] QR code generation creates valid codes
- [x] Tray menu responds to clicks
- [ ] **Server stops when Stop is clicked** ‚ö†Ô∏è **BROKEN**
- [x] WebSocket connections work
- [x] Mouse/keyboard input functions correctly

### Compatibility

## üéØ **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

**For Stop Functionality Fix:**
1. Click "Stop" in tray menu ‚Üí Server immediately logs receiving Stop command
2. Server cleanly shuts down and releases port 8080
3. Tray menu updates to show "Start" option
4. No hanging processes or blocked threads

**For Overall Project:**
1. Reliable start/stop server functionality
2. Stable WebSocket connections
3. Accurate input simulation
4. Professional user experience
